## The importance of Machine learning in mitigating financial risk.

The financial sector in which operates throughout the world as we know, is arguably the most predominant and most influential industry throughout.

Since the worlds earliest records, there has been a strong need and importance in the financial sector in a developing and evolving economy and nation.
The earliest and most notable signs of the importance of the financial sector would be apparent as the need and use of the banking system. It is often that societies and civilizations as well as indiviuals would need help in the form of financial services.

Things such as;

-Lending
-Management
-Advice
-Investing

As in any industry and any society, no matter how advanced or behind, there is always ways and opportunities to cheat the system, and gain and leverage mis information or poor security & operations, in order for financial gain.

In Modern times this is more apparent then ever as technology evolves.
We see more and more cases of fraud and data theft within the financial sector each year, costing businesses, individuals, and the economy billions of dollars.

For a large business handling millions of transactions daily, such as banks, lenders, and governments this problem is impossible to manage well with just human resources, it entails the need for much better protection and risk management, through advancing technologies.

The need for better risk management and fraud detection bring forth the use of MachineLearning in the industry, to be able to better detect fraud, quicker and much more effective then people.

The Purpose of this Code and the Assignment Is to use and develope machine learning models to prove the importance and the effectiveness of this technology in the industry, and how it should be implimented across the board.

The Data Set involved is a Credit Card transactions data set. This Data set has no obfuscation as it has more then 20 million transactions generated from a virtual world simulation.
The Data covers 2000 synthetic consumer residents in the US, who travel the world.

The Reason We chose to use this data set is to be able to provide a good Analysis using the actual information provided, instead of only providing obscured data for the purpose of making a model, which would be the case if using real information. The Dataset is based on Real Data, provided by IBM, but is synthesised for the prupose of privacy and restrictions of consumers.

We hope that a strong argument and conclusion can be made from the Data and Analysis, and the benefits and use of ML can be recognised widespread for positive uses.
