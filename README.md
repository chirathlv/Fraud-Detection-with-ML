## Introduction - Machine Learning and Risk mitigation in Finance
The financial sector in which operates throughout the world as we know, is arguably the most predominant and most influential industry throughout.

As in any industry and any society, no matter how advanced or behind, there is always ways and opportunities to cheat the system, and gain and leverage mis information or poor security & operations, in order for financial gain.

As the world evolves and technology advances,We see more and more cases of fraud and data theft within the financial sector each year, costing businesses, individuals, and the economy billions of dollars.

The Purpose of this Code and the Assignment Is to use and develope machine learning models to prove the importance and the effectiveness of this technology in the industry, and how it should be implimented across the board.

## Data, Technology and Coding Standards.

### Data Sources

  1.Credit Card Data For ML model. (Kaggle)
  
 The Data Set used for the machine learning model is a Credit Card transactions data set. This Data set has no obfuscation as it has more then 20 million transactions generated from a virtual world simulation.
The Data covers 2000 synthetic consumer residents in the US, who travel the world.

  2.Fraud Statistics.
   -The Ascent
   -Federal Trade Commision.

## Data Cleaning and Visualisation

### Data Cleaning

The following Data cleaning procedure has been followed in order to produce accurate representations in our Machine Learning Model.

1.Identify data set is accurate for the ML model and Analysis.
2.Load data into jupyter notebook.
3.Rename Columns to Suit layout and analysis.
4.Basic Cleaning techniques,duplicates and unwanted columns.
5.Check the target variable class Ratio.
6.Check nulls/nans & further inspect.
7.Fill missing data values with 0.
8.Split time collumn into hours & minutes, then drop 'Time' column.
9.Re-arrange respective columns.
10.Format appropriate columns and change D-types where needed.
11.Transform 'Merchant Name' columns with label encoder.
12.Save Cleaned Data for use in Machine Learning Algorithm.
